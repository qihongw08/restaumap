# Prisma migrations

- **Do not manually create or edit migration SQL files** in `prisma/migrations/`.
- When schema changes require a migration:
  1. Update `prisma/schema.prisma` only.
  2. Tell the user to run the migration command themselves, for example:
     - `bunx prisma migrate dev --name <descriptive_name>`
     - or `npx prisma migrate dev --name <descriptive_name>`
  3. Ask the user to confirm the command completed successfully (or paste the result) before relying on the new migration in further steps.

This keeps migrations generated by Prisma and avoids drift or duplicate migration folders.
